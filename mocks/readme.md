## Launch Landing
Upon launch of the mobile application, th user is presented with a landing screen that positions/frames the application and its gneral use
- name of app at the top of the page
- scrollview with expanded content area
- go button to trigger load of the solar map
- image of the sun emphasizing heliocentric nature of the model

###launch landing scrollview content
The scrollview content position/explains the application/model and its general use.
- presents users with a start to finish still map of the model's duration
- highlight use of 'Planet Cards'

#
## Solar Map
The solar map geolocates the user relative to the starting point of the model
- once located the map renders a path to the starting point of the model
- 'go button' initiates the AR layer

##### Solar Map

#
## AR Layer
This is the primary view, presenting live, dynamic content
- text on top bar updates over the course of travel through the model, interaction is like that of 'pop-up video'
- image is live rendering of the camera view, renders planetary objects based on barcode triggers
- horizontal navigation at the bottom presents of series of buttons contained within a scrollview, each triggering display of a 'planet card'
##### AR Layer

#
## Planet Cards
Context and information about each of the planets in the model
- still image at top presents a view f teh panetary subject
- planet name reaffirmed in title format
- location specifics indicate cross streets and corner, landmarks
- scrollview presents further context 
- X at the bottom returns the viewer to the AR layer
##### Planet Card

#### Planet Card Content
![sketch01](https://github.com/moriartp/ms2/blob/master/mocks/_03-planetCardContent.jpg)
The planet card content is displayed within the scrollview, presents further context about the planet and its place within the model
- presents a visual size comparison of the planet against a similarly sized everyday object
- map still displaying the full orbital range of the planet within the Manhattan context
- bar comparison of average walking time within the model, versus the light minutes within the solar system
- street view image specifying the location of the marker
- display of the barcaode marker for reference
